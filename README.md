# JavaScript_JSON_Frequency_Mapping
Using JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax to count word frequencies or number occurrences in a JSON text file.

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON stores data that is both machine and human readable. 
JSON does this by formatting data as array text files.
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the process of counting the frequency occurrence of words and numbers in a given JSON text file.
The script can be used for data mining, pattern matching, machine learning and to curate trending topics.
The scripts make use of JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, HTML and JSON files.
The Script is written by Vakindu Philliam.
